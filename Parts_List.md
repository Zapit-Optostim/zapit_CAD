### 3. Fibre-coupling parts
If you wish to launch a non-fibre-coupled laser into the scan-head via a fibre then you will need to buy these parts.
If your laser is already fibre-coupled you will need only the collimating lens.
Do not buy the FibrePort and the Fibre if you have a laser that is shipped fibre-coupled.
You may also launch the laser directly into the scan-head using mirrors.
There is no parts list for this option, but if you choose it and are using the custom enclosure you will want to add a glass window over the galvo entry port. A [WG11010-A](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=WG11010-A) is suitable.

| Item | Description | Approx Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| |2m fibre patch cable | 200 GBP |
| |FiberPort Collimator | 500 GBP |
| | Collimating lens for fibre | 200 GBP |
